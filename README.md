•	I have created an iOS app (using XCode and CoreML) which detects food and calorie based on an image. 
•	The project is based on Image Recognition using Python, CNN, Tensorflow, Keras, CUDA, CUDnn. https://github.com/ahada2/deeplearningproject 
•	This is CNN‐based food item recognition based on a labeled dataset which has food name and calorie information.
•	Finally, I integrated this model with an iOS app by converting the CNN model to MLModel using CoreML.
•	The idea is that a user can take a picture and the app will detect the food item and predict its calorie count.
•	Here is the demo of the final app: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cfYREaRcxzH478vQYWC85lbvmxVe5Gaa/view?usp=sharing
